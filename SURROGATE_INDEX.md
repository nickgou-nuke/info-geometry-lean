# Surrogate Index

Generated: `2026-03-20 18:54:35`

This report tracks explicit proof gaps, assumption-bearing theorem surfaces, and named contract interfaces so surrogate debt can be replaced aggressively with real proofs.

## Hard Gate
- `scripts/audit_surrogates.sh`: **PASS**
- last gate output:
  - `[surrogate-audit] checking for direct open/namespace references to InfoGeometry.Unstable`
  - `[surrogate-audit] checking for placeholder/surrogate keywords outside allowed paths`
  - `[surrogate-audit] checking for banned surrogate declarations in stable modules`
  - `[surrogate-audit] checking canonical modules for reflexive Prop wrappers (heuristic)`
  - `[surrogate-audit] checking canonical surface for forbidden Canonical tactic usage`
  - `[surrogate-audit] OK`

## Aggressive Replacement Queue

## Explicit Proof Holes

- none

## Explicit Axiom Declarations

- none

## Conditional Theorem Surface

- none

## Named Contract Declarations

- none

## Contract Constructors

- none

## Stable Surrogate/Placeholder Markers

- none

## Policy
- explicit proof holes and explicit axioms are not acceptable end-state theory surface
- conditional wrappers are tolerated only when the missing obligation is explicit and scheduled for replacement
- contract declarations must not be confused with completed proofs
- contract constructors are lower-risk adapters from concrete data into contract surfaces; they should not dominate the replacement queue
- replacement priority is: canonical proof holes -> stable axioms -> canonical conditional wrappers -> open contract interfaces
