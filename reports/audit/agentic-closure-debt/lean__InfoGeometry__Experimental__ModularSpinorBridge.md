## Findings by file

### `lean/InfoGeometry/Experimental/ModularSpinorBridge.lean`
- module: `InfoGeometry.Experimental.ModularSpinorBridge`
- status: `advisory`
- debt_score: `15`
- findings:
  - L1 [advisory] `coding-agent-audit-error` in `file <file-level>` — coding-agent audit command failed: Error: failed to initialize in-process app-server client: Read-only file system (os error 30)
