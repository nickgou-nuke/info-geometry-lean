## Findings by file

### `lean/InfoGeometry/Canonical/Algebra.lean`
- module: `InfoGeometry.Canonical.Algebra`
- status: `advisory`
- debt_score: `4`
- findings:
  - L1 [advisory] `coding-agent-audit-error` in `file <file-level>` — coding-agent audit command failed: Error: failed to initialize in-process app-server client: Read-only file system (os error 30)
  - L52 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field UnifiedProjection.projectors_compatible` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L64 [advisory] `injected-hypothesis-surface` in `variable <section-variable>` — section variable assumption detected (valid pattern; track for closure debt)
