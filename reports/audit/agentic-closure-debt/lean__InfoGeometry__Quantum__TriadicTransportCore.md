## Findings by file

### `lean/InfoGeometry/Quantum/TriadicTransportCore.lean`
- module: `InfoGeometry.Quantum.TriadicTransportCore`
- status: `advisory`
- debt_score: `24`
- findings:
  - L1 [advisory] `coding-agent-audit-error` in `file <file-level>` — coding-agent audit command failed: Error: failed to initialize in-process app-server client: Read-only file system (os error 30)
  - L26 [advisory] `notation-or-macro-warp` in `syntax <notation-or-macro>` — local notation/macro detected; verify it does not hide meaning or redefine a proof-relevant surface
  - L34 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Probe_proj` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L36 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Addr_proj` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L38 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Content_proj` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L40 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Probe_sq` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L43 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Addr_sq` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L44 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Content_sq` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L45 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Probe_Addr_disjoint` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L48 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Addr_Probe_disjoint` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L49 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Update` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L56 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Update_weight_hom` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L66 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field TriadicTransportData.Update_content_hom` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
