## Findings by file

### `lean/InfoGeometry/Canonical/QuantumInference.lean`
- module: `InfoGeometry.Canonical.QuantumInference`
- status: `advisory`
- debt_score: `13`
- findings:
  - L1 [advisory] `coding-agent-audit-error` in `file <file-level>` — coding-agent audit command failed: Error: failed to initialize in-process app-server client: Read-only file system (os error 30)
  - L35 [advisory] `notation-or-macro-warp` in `syntax <notation-or-macro>` — local notation/macro detected; verify it does not hide meaning or redefine a proof-relevant surface
  - L37 [advisory] `notation-or-macro-warp` in `syntax <notation-or-macro>` — local notation/macro detected; verify it does not hide meaning or redefine a proof-relevant surface
  - L61 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field CCR.a` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L62 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field CCR.adag` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L63 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field CCR.comm_a_adag` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L64 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field CCR.comm_a_a` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L65 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field CCR.comm_adag_adag` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
