## Findings by file

### `lean/InfoGeometry/Canonical/DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitBridge.lean`
- module: `InfoGeometry.Canonical.DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitBridge`
- status: `advisory`
- debt_score: `26`
- findings:
  - L1 [advisory] `coding-agent-audit-error` in `file <file-level>` — coding-agent audit command failed: Error: failed to initialize in-process app-server client: Read-only file system (os error 30)

  - L39 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.uPlus_mul_P` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L40 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.P0_mul_uPlus` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L41 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.P0_mul_uMinus` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L43 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.uMinus_mul_P` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L44 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.uMinus_mul_P0` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L45 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.P_mul_uMinus` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L46 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.uPlus_sq` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L48 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.uMinus_sq` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L49 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.uPlus_mul_uMinus` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L50 [soft] `law-field-locker` in `structure-field DrazinCliffordMatrixUnitCell.uMinus_mul_uPlus` — Prop/equality/order/forall-like structure field detected; this may store a theorem as an assumption unless instantiated from mathlib/repo proofs
  - L55 [advisory] `injected-hypothesis-surface` in `variable <section-variable>` — section variable assumption detected (valid pattern; track for closure debt)
